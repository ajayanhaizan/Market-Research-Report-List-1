<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lab-Grown Diamonds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD Diamonds</li><li>HTHP Diamonds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lab-grown diamonds market is primarily divided into two types: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) diamonds and High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT) diamonds. CVD diamonds are created by evaporating carbon-rich gases, allowing carbon atoms to crystallize into diamond form. In contrast, HPHT diamonds mimic natural conditions by applying extreme heat and pressure to carbon sources. Both types offer ethical, sustainable alternatives to mined diamonds, catering to growing consumer demand for environmentally conscious products while providing similar aesthetic and physical properties.</p></p>
