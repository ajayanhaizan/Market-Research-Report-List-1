<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Authentication Services Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Factor Authentication</li><li>Multi-Factor Authentication</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The authentication services market is primarily categorized into Single-Factor Authentication (SFA) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). SFA relies on one method, typically a password, to verify a user’s identity, making it simpler but less secure. Conversely, MFA combines multiple verification methods, such as something the user knows (password), has (a smartphone), or is (biometric). This layered approach enhances security, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, and is increasingly preferred by organizations to protect sensitive information and comply with regulations.</p></p>
