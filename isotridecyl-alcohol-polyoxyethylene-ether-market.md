<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Isotridecyl Alcohol Polyoxyethylene Ether Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HLB≥ 10</li><li>HLB<10</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Isotridecyl Alcohol Polyoxyethylene Ether market is categorized based on the Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance (HLB) values, distinguishing between HLB≥10 and HLB<10 types. HLB≥10 represents surfactants with a higher affinity for water, making them suitable for applications like emulsifying, dispersing, and stabilizing in aqueous systems. In contrast, HLB<10 surfactants have greater lipophilicity, rendering them more effective for oil-in-water emulsions and applications in non-aqueous systems. This segmentation helps industries select appropriate surfactants based on their formulation needs.</p></p>
