<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebral Flow Diverter and Disruptor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flow Diverters</li><li>Endosaccular Disruptors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cerebral flow diverter market includes devices designed to redirect blood flow away from aneurysms, thereby promoting their healing and reducing rupture risk. These flow diverters support the formation of a stable parent artery while maintaining blood flow. On the other hand, endosaccular disruptors target the aneurysm sac directly, disrupting blood flow within it and leading to thrombosis. Both approaches aim to enhance patient outcomes in treating cerebral aneurysms, offering distinct mechanisms to manage vascular lesions effectively.</p></p>
