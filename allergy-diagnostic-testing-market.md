<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Allergy Diagnostic Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Blood Testing</li><li>Skin Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Allergy diagnostic testing includes two primary market types: blood testing and skin testing. Blood testing involves measuring specific antibodies in the bloodstream, indicating an allergic response to various allergens. Common methods include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and radioallergosorbent tests (RAST). Skin testing, on the other hand, involves exposing the skin to small amounts of allergens through pricks, scratches, or intradermal injections to observe reactions. Both methods help determine sensitivities, guiding appropriate treatment and management of allergies.</p></p>
