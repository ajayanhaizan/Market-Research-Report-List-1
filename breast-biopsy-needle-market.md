<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breast Biopsy Needle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Needle Based Biopsy</li><li>Surgical Biopsy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The breast biopsy needle market encompasses two primary types: needle-based biopsies and surgical biopsies. Needle-based biopsies involve minimally invasive techniques using fine or core needles to extract tissue samples for analysis, providing accuracy with reduced recovery times. In contrast, surgical biopsies are more invasive procedures where a larger tissue sample is surgically obtained, often under general anesthesia, and are typically used when needle biopsies are inconclusive. Both types are crucial for diagnosing breast conditions effectively.</p></p>
