<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seismic Isolation Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastomeric Bearings</li><li>Sliding Bearings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The seismic isolation bearings market consists primarily of elastomeric bearings and sliding bearings. Elastomeric bearings utilize rubber layers to absorb seismic energy, allowing structures to flex during an earthquake, thereby minimizing damage. Sliding bearings, on the other hand, reduce seismic forces by allowing a structure to move horizontally during seismic events, thus decoupling it from ground motion. Both types enhance the resilience of buildings and infrastructure, serving as crucial components in earthquake engineering and design.</p></p>
